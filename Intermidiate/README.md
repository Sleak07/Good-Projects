1. Conceptualize the Game Structure
Objective: Mutate DNA sequences using string operations and regex.

Core Gameplay Loop:

Present mutation task.

Player inputs string or regex command.

Validate and show result.

Provide feedback.

Progression: Simple to advanced string and regex operations.

2. Terminal-Based User Interface Design
UI Library Options: Pythonâ€™s rich or curses, Node.js blessed.

Design Sections:

DNA sequence display with base colors.

Task prompt describing mutations.

Input section for commands/regex.

Feedback area for successes/errors.

3. DNA String Manipulation Mechanics
Operations: Replace, delete, insert, extract.

Regex Features: Match/extract codon patterns.

Special Mutations: Reverse complements and multi-step edits.

4. Task System
Challenges including:

Replace all A with T.

Find sequences starting with ATG.

Extract codons by pattern.

Multi-phase mutations.

Difficulty scales with player progress.

5. Input Parsing & Validation
Interpret regex and string operation commands.

Validate edits against expected results.

Deliver descriptive feedback and hints.

6. Game Loop & Progression
Show task.

Receive input.

Validate and score.

Advance or retry.

Scoring based on correctness and efficiency.

Hints available for stuck players.

7. Testing & Refinement
Playtest for clarity, UI, and difficulty.

Ensure regex tasks are accessible.

Polish terminal colors and layouts.

Add DNA sequence variety for replay.

End Goal:
An engaging terminal game progressively teaching regex and string manipulation through interactive DNA mutations.
